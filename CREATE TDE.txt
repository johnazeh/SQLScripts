STEP 1

USE master; 

CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = ‘VeryStrongPassword’;

GO

STEP 2
---CREATE CERTIFICATE FOR TDE
USE master; 

CREATE CERTIFICATE TDECert WITH SUBJECT= 'TDE Certification'; 

GO

--STEP 3
Backup Certificate
This is super important because if you lose your certificate, you lose your data, period.

That’s why, best practice is taking backup immediately after you create it.

BACKUP CERTIFICATE TDECert
TO FILE = ‘D:\BK\MyTDECert.cer’
WITH PRIVATE KEY
(
FILE = ‘D:\BK\CertPrivateKey.key’,
ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = ‘VeryStrongPassword’
);
GO

STEP 4  -Create Database Encryption Key

CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY
WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256
ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE TDECert;

STEP 5

 Enable Encryption


ALTER DATABASE TDETest SET ENCRYPTION ON;

ALTER DATABASE TDETest SET ENCRYPTION SUSPEND;

ALTER DATABASE TDETest SET ENCRYPTION RESUME;

Database is encrypted now on the physical layer.
